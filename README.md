This is a request for proposals (RFP) for implementing the MVP release of OMA3's token architecture.  The token architecture is not a standards effort so does not need to follow the typical process OMA3 uses for standards.  However, OMA3 is still soliciting contributions to help build this governance tool.

Please comment on the paper by [creating an issue](https://github.com/oma3dao/token-mvp-rfp/issues/new) or commenting in the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19K8j7QmPQTBgGoGc7rfCCs0NFvqhTObX1zszk6g5aws/edit?usp=sharing).
